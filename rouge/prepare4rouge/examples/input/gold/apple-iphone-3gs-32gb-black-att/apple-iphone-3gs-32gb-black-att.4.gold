synchs with my work email and it even has a phone too
this is a nice phone
and much better than it's older versions
the iphone 3gs is not perfect
it is at the very top
superb web browsing
excellent music experience
ridiculously intuitive and easy to use user interface
i would have to say that the 3
0 update has made my wi fi horrible
battery life could be better and there still isn't multitasking
