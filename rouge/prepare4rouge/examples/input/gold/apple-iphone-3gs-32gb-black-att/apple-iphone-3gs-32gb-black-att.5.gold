bigger and better screen
it can do everything a blackberry can do but with a lot more style !
fast 3g speed
good battery life
great built in apps
great call quality and great 3g reception
dont know where you get that it does not have great call quality and reception
i keep hearing that sound quality is bad
but either i have really good ears or the majority of people out there have really bad hearing
